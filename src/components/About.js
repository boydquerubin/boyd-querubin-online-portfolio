        <p>
          My career began with a Bachelor's Degree in Communications, and since early 2020, Iâ€™ve worked as a marketer and content creator. Over time, I transitioned into software engineering, where I discovered a real passion for building web applications. I enjoy working with modern tools and technologies like React and Python to develop practical applications for everyday use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about technology and innovation, I am currently
          transitioning to a career in software engineering and web development.
          Driven by a love for coding and design, I am actively developing an
          online portfolio to showcase my growing skills in these fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my professional interests, I'm a devoted husband and father
          of three wonderful children. I enjoy volleyball, exploring new coding
          challenges, and cherishing moments with my family.
